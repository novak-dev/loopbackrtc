# LoopbackRTC

This is a basic Android demo app to showcase establish a WebRTC connection.
It will stream video from a file in a loop from one peer to another, both
from the same Android device acting as a loopback test.

There is no signaling mechanism, it is purely peer to peer.

It is basically an Android implementation of this sample:
